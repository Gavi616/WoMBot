# Witches of Midnight hackbot (modified from Blades in the Dicebot)

A Discord bot custom made for Blades in the Dark.

Simpler syntax and clearer results.  
Handles 0d, critical results and resistances rolls.  

## How to install

Just follow this link:
https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=7b2418374a35ce74c723&scope=bot&permissions=32768

The link will prompt you to authorize the bot on a server. It needs permissions to allow embeds (makes things look pretty). Once the bot's authorized, you'll see it in the Member List. In a public channel just type any of the commands outlined below and the bot will answer with a dice roll.
